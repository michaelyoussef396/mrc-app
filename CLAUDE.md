## 🤖 Automatic Agent Orchestration

Claude Code automatically invokes agents based on **conversation context** without explicit commands.

### Trigger Phrases That Auto-Invoke Agents

| Your Message | Auto-Invoked Agents | Why |
|--------------|---------------------|-----|
| "I'm building a new component" | TypeScript Pro → React Performance Optimization → mobile-tester | Type definitions → Optimized component → Mobile testing |
| "I modified the pricing logic" | pricing-calculator (BLOCKING) | Validate 13% cap immediately |
| "Ready to deploy" | Security Auditor → pricing-calculator → Web Vitals Optimizer | 3 deployment blockers |
| "I changed the database schema" | Supabase Schema Architect → SQL Pro → Security Auditor | Schema → RLS verification |
| "The form looks wrong on mobile" | mobile-tester (all viewports) | UI issue triggers mobile testing |
| "I updated authentication" | Security Auditor → Code Reviewer | Auth changes need security scan |
| "Added a new page" | mobile-tester → Web Vitals Optimizer → Code Reviewer | UI + Performance + Quality |

| "Working on offline mode" | offline-architect → mobile-tester | Service worker → Test offline |
| "Need to optimize performance" | Performance Profiler → React Performance Optimization | Diagnose → Optimize |

### Smart Agent Chaining (Automatic Sequences)

**UI Component Task:**
```
You: "I need to build the inspection form"

Claude Code automatically:
1. 🤖 TypeScript Pro - "Defining interfaces first..."
2. 🤖 React Performance Optimization - "Building optimized component..."
3. 🤖 mobile-tester - "Testing at all viewports..."
4. 🤖 Web Vitals Optimizer - "Checking performance..."
5. 🤖 Code Reviewer - "Reviewing code quality..."
✅ Complete: All agents passed
```

**Database Change Task:**
```
You: "I'm adding a new table for invoices"

Claude Code automatically:
1. 🤖 Supabase Schema Architect - "Designing schema..."
2. 🤖 SQL Pro - "Writing migration..."
3. 🤖 Security Auditor - "Verifying RLS policies..."
4. 🤖 TypeScript Pro - "Generating types..."
✅ Complete: Schema ready
```

**Pricing Change Task (CRITICAL):**
```
You: "I updated the discount calculation"

Claude Code automatically:
1. 🤖 pricing-calculator - "⚠️ BLOCKING: Validating pricing..."
   ↓ If FAIL: "❌ 13% cap violated. Fix before continuing."
   ↓ If PASS: ✅ "All 48 scenarios passed"
2. 🤖 Test Engineer - "Adding regression tests..."
3. 🤖 Code Reviewer - "Reviewing pricing logic..."
✅ Complete: Pricing validated
```

### Context Detection Rules

Claude Code analyzes your message for:
- **Keywords:** "component", "pricing", "deploy", "schema", "mobile", "auth"
- **File mentions:** "LeadCard.tsx", "pricing.ts", "schema.sql"
- **Action verbs:** "building", "fixing", "deploying", "testing", "reviewing"
- **Problem indicators:** "broken", "slow", "error", "bug", "issue"

Then automatically invokes relevant agents.

### File Watch Triggers (Automatic)

When you modify specific files, agents auto-trigger:

| File Pattern | Agent Triggered | Delay | Blocking |
|--------------|----------------|-------|----------|
| `src/components/**/*.tsx` | mobile-tester | 2s | No |
| `src/pages/**/*.tsx` | mobile-tester | 2s | No |
| `**/pricing*.ts` | pricing-calculator | 0s | **YES** |
| `src/lib/auth/**/*.ts` | Security Auditor | 3s | No |
| `supabase/migrations/*.sql` | Supabase Schema Architect | 2s | No |
| `src/types/**/*.ts` | TypeScript Pro | 1s | No |
| `src/**/*.ts` or `src/**/*.tsx` | Code Reviewer | 5s | No |

**Example:**
```
You save: src/components/LeadCard.tsx
  ↓ (2 second delay)
🤖 mobile-tester triggered automatically
  ↓ (runs tests)
✅ Mobile tests passed at 375px, 768px, 1440px
  ↓ (5 second delay)
🤖 Code Reviewer triggered automatically
  ↓ (reviews code)
✅ Code quality approved
```

### Workflow Stage Hooks (Automatic)

Agents trigger automatically at workflow stages:

**On File Save:**
- UI files → mobile-tester (2s delay)
- Pricing files → pricing-calculator (immediate, blocking)
- Auth files → Security Auditor (3s delay)

**Pre-Commit:**
- Mobile-First Verification (if UI changed)
- Pricing Validation (if pricing changed) - **BLOCKING**
- Security Scan (if auth/migrations changed)
- Code Quality Review

**Pre-Push (Deployment Blockers):**
1. 🚨 Security Auditor (MANDATORY)
2. 🚨 pricing-calculator (MANDATORY)
3. 🚨 Web Vitals Optimizer (MANDATORY)

**All 3 must pass before push is allowed.**

3. 🚨 Use pricing-calculator to validate ALL 48 scenarios (DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER)
4. If pricing-calculator PASSES, use Code Reviewer to review changes
5. Use Test Engineer to add regression tests

⚠️ WARNING: If pricing-calculator FAILS, changes CANNOT be deployed.
The 13% discount cap is ABSOLUTE and cannot be exceeded.

Let me check if 10% discount for 2-day jobs conflicts with the 13% cap..."

[Agent calculates scenarios and validates with pricing-calculator]

### **Example 4: Pre-Deployment Check**

**User Task:** "I'm ready to deploy to production. Run all pre-deployment checks."

**Claude Response:**
```
"Running MANDATORY pre-deployment workflow. All agents must PASS to approve deployment.

Step 1/5: Security Auditor - Full security scan...
✅ PASSED - Zero high/critical vulnerabilities found

Step 2/5: pricing-calculator - Validating all 48 pricing scenarios...
✅ PASSED - All 48 scenarios correct, 13% cap enforced

Step 3/5: Web Vitals Optimizer - Performance audit...
✅ PASSED - Mobile: 94/100, Desktop: 98/100, Load time: 2.1s

Step 4/5: React Performance Optimization - Bundle size check...
✅ PASSED - Total bundle: 487KB (under 500KB limit)

Step 5/5: Test Engineer - CI/CD verification...
✅ PASSED - All 127 tests passing, no failures

🟢 DEPLOYMENT APPROVED
All 5 mandatory agents passed. Safe to deploy to production."

[Agent provides detailed reports for each check]

### **Example 5: Adding New Database Table**

**User Task:** "I need to add a new table for job completion tracking with photos, notes, and customer signature."

**Claude Response:**
```
"I'll design this database table using the proper agent workflow:

1. Use Supabase Schema Architect to design the job_completions table schema
   - Include fields for job_id, photos (JSONB array), notes (TEXT), signature_url, completed_at
   - Plan foreign key relationships to jobs table
   - Design RLS policies for technician access

2. Use SQL Pro to write the optimized migration SQL
   - Create table with proper indexes
   - Add foreign key constraints
   - Implement RLS policies
   - Add audit columns (created_at, updated_at, created_by)

3. Use Security Auditor to verify RLS policies are secure
   - Test with technician role (can only see assigned jobs)
   - Test with admin role (can see all jobs)
   - Verify no unauthorized access possible

4. Use TypeScript Pro to generate updated TypeScript types
   - Run supabase gen types typescript
   - Update src/types/database.types.ts

Let's start with Supabase Schema Architect..."

[Agent executes database design workflow]

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: "I modified code but forgot to run mobile-tester"**

**Problem:** Changed UI component but didn't test mobile viewport

**Solution:**
```
mobile-tester is marked PROACTIVE and should auto-trigger on UI changes.

To manually invoke:
"Use mobile-tester to test [component name] at all viewports (375px, 768px, 1440px).
Verify touch targets ≥48px, check for horizontal scrolling, capture screenshots."

REMINDER: ALWAYS test 375px FIRST, desktop is secondary.
```

---

### **Issue 2: "Pricing calculation seems wrong but tests are passing"**

**Problem:** Pricing logic looks incorrect but pricing-calculator reports PASS

**Solution:**
```
The pricing-calculator has 48 comprehensive test scenarios. If it reports PASS,
the pricing IS correct according to business rules.

Business rules are:
- 13% discount cap (0.87 minimum multiplier) - ABSOLUTE
- GST 10% on subtotal
- Multi-day discounts: 0% (≤8h), 7.5% (9-16h), 13% (17+h)

If you believe business rules should be different, consult with business owners FIRST.
Then update pricing logic AND test scenarios together.

To validate specific scenario:
"Use pricing-calculator to validate this specific pricing scenario:
[describe scenario with exact hours, work type, equipment, expected price]"
```

---

### **Issue 3: "Security Auditor found vulnerabilities but I don't know how to fix them"**

**Problem:** Security scan found issues but fixes are unclear

**Solution:**
```
Security Auditor provides specific details about each vulnerability.

Common fixes:

1. Hardcoded secrets:
   - Move to .env file
   - Add .env to .gitignore
   - Use environment variables: process.env.VARIABLE_NAME

2. Missing RLS policies:
   - Add RLS policy to table: ALTER TABLE tablename ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   - Create policy: CREATE POLICY policy_name ON tablename FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

3. XSS vulnerabilities:
   - Sanitize user inputs with DOMPurify
   - Use textContent instead of innerHTML
   - Validate all form inputs with Zod schemas

4. SQL injection:
   - Use Supabase client (parameterized queries)
   - NEVER concatenate strings in SQL
   - Use .eq(), .in(), .filter() methods

Ask Security Auditor for specific fix recommendations:
"Use Security Auditor to provide detailed fix recommendations for [specific vulnerability]"
```

---

### **Issue 4: "Bundle size is too large (>500KB)"**

**Problem:** React Performance Optimization reports bundle over limit

**Solution:**
```
Use React Performance Optimization agent to reduce bundle size:

"Use React Performance Optimization to analyze bundle and suggest optimizations.
Focus on:
- Lazy loading routes with React.lazy()
- Code splitting for large components
- Tree shaking unused dependencies
- Optimizing images and assets
- Removing unused npm packages

Target: Reduce bundle from [current size] to <500KB"

Common fixes:
1. Lazy load routes:
   const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('./pages/Dashboard'))

2. Split large components:
   const HeavyComponent = lazy(() => import('./components/HeavyComponent'))

3. Optimize images:
   - Compress images to <1MB before upload
   - Use WebP format
   - Implement lazy loading for images

4. Remove unused dependencies:
   - Run: npx depcheck
   - Remove unused packages: npm uninstall [package]
```

### **Issue 5: "Not sure which agent to use for my task"**

**Problem:** Unclear which agent(s) are appropriate for current work

**Solution:**
```
Read MRC-AGENT-WORKFLOW.md for complete agent usage guide.

### **Issue 6: "Agent failed but I don't understand why"**

**Problem:** Agent reports failure with unclear error message

**Solution:**
```
Each agent provides specific failure details. Review the agent's output carefully.

To get more details:
"Use [Agent Name] again and provide more detailed explanation of why it failed.
Include specific file paths, line numbers, and fix recommendations."

For each agent type:

mobile-tester failed:
├─→ Check viewport screenshots for visual issues
├─→ Verify touch targets are ≥48px
├─→ Check for horizontal scrolling
└─→ Test manually at 375px in browser DevTools

pricing-calculator failed:
├─→ CRITICAL: Review which scenarios failed
├─→ Check if 13% cap was exceeded
├─→ Verify GST calculations (should be 10%)
├─→ Check multi-day discount logic
└─→ DO NOT DEPLOY until fixed

Security Auditor failed:
├─→ Review specific vulnerabilities listed
├─→ Check for hardcoded secrets
├─→ Verify RLS policies on all tables
├─→ Run npm audit manually
└─→ Fix issues before deployment

Web Vitals Optimizer failed:
├─→ Check specific metrics that failed (LCP, FID, CLS)
├─→ Look for render-blocking resources
├─→ Optimize large images/assets
└─→ Reduce JavaScript bundle size

Code Reviewer found issues:
├─→ Review specific code quality concerns
├─→ Check for code smells or anti-patterns
├─→ Verify best practices are followed
└─→ Refactor as recommended
```
