Inspection Report Summary - Causes and Prevention 35 Wellington Street, Mernda, VIC, 3754 --- Summary of Findings The inspection at 35 Wellington Street, Mernda, revealed significant mould growth in the master bedroom, particularly on the wall behind the bed, with moisture readings of 42% and active water infiltration confirmed via infrared observations. The primary cause of the mould is water intrusion, likely due to a combination of poor subfloor ventilation and elevated indoor humidity levels. Immediate risks include structural damage to the wall and potential health hazards for occupants, as prolonged exposure to mould spores can exacerbate respiratory issues. The subfloor inspection also indicated the need for sanitation and racking, suggesting broader moisture management issues within the property. Given the extent of the mould and the demolition required, urgent remediation is necessary to prevent further deterioration and ensure a safe living environment. --- Identified Causes Primary Cause: Water infiltration through the wall behind the bed, leading to elevated moisture levels and mould growth. Contributing Factors: 1. Poor subfloor ventilation, as evidenced by the need for racking and sanitation, which has likely contributed to moisture retention. 2. Inadequate indoor humidity control, with readings of 12% in the master bedroom, which, while low, may not reflect the actual conditions due to localized water intrusion. 3. Structural vulnerabilities in the wall, allowing water to seep in and create an ideal environment for mould proliferation. 4. Lack of regular maintenance or early detection, as the mould growth appears to have progressed significantly before intervention. --- Recommendations Immediate Actions: 1. Demolish and remove the affected section of the wall behind the bed - This is necessary to eliminate the mould source and prevent further spread. 2. Implement HEPA vacuuming and antimicrobial treatment - To remove mould spores and treat the area to inhibit regrowth. Ongoing Prevention: 1. Install or improve subfloor ventilation systems - To reduce moisture buildup and prevent future mould issues. 2. Regularly monitor indoor humidity levels and use dehumidifiers if necessary - Maintaining humidity between 30-50% can significantly reduce mould risk. 3. Conduct periodic inspections of walls and subfloor areas - Early detection of water intrusion or mould growth can prevent extensive damage and costly remediation. --- Overview and Conclusion The mould issue at 35 Wellington Street is primarily due to water infiltration in the master bedroom, compounded by poor subfloor ventilation and inadequate humidity control. Immediate actions, including demolition of the affected wall and antimicrobial treatment, are essential to address the current problem. Ongoing prevention measures, such as improving ventilation and regular monitoring, will help mitigate future risks. By addressing these issues comprehensively, the property can be restored to a safe and healthy condition, ensuring long-term protection against mould recurrence. It is recommended that the client proceed with the outlined remediation plan to safeguard both the structural integrity of the home and the well-being of its occupants."

                - textbox "Describe what mould issues were found during the inspection..." [ref=e215]: During our inspection at 35 Wellington Street, Mernda, we identified mould growth in the master bedroom, particularly on the wall behind the bed. The severity of the mould was significant, with moisture readings reaching 42% in this area. This high moisture level suggests a persistent dampness issue, likely contributing to the mould problem. Additionally, the subfloor showed signs of moisture, which may require further attention to prevent future mould growth. The primary areas of concern are the master bedroom and the subfloor. The mould in the bedroom will need targeted treatment, including HEPA vacuuming and antimicrobial applications, to ensure thorough removal and prevent regrowth. We also recommend addressing the underlying moisture issues to safeguard your home’s long-term health. Our team will use commercial dehumidifiers and air movers to aid in drying out the affected areas effectively.

(MRC) will implement a thorough remediation plan to ensure a safe and healthy environment. The process will begin with the careful removal of affected materials in the master bedroom, including any damaged drywall or insulation, as indicated by the high moisture reading of 42% behind the bed. This demolition will be conducted with precision to minimise disruption while ensuring all contaminated materials are safely disposed of. Following demolition, we will perform a deep clean using HEPA vacuuming to remove mould spores from surfaces and the air. An antimicrobial treatment will then be applied to eliminate remaining mould and prevent regrowth, followed by a stain-removing antimicrobial to restore the appearance of treated areas. To ensure comprehensive coverage, we will also conduct a home sanitation fogging process. Drying equipment, including two commercial dehumidifiers and one air mover, will be deployed to reduce moisture levels and prevent future mould growth. The entire process is expected to take approximately 3–5 days, depending on drying conditions, with minimal inconvenience to the household. Our team will work efficiently to restore your home to a safe, mould-free condition.
