Example:
"Hey Mobile Tester,

I found 2 mobile blockers during calendar testing:

1. Touch targets on date cells = 36px (need 48px)
2. Horizontal scroll at 375px viewport

Can you verify after I fix these?

## 📝 NOTES & REMINDERS

### Critical Principles
1. **Mobile-First Always** - Test 375px viewport FIRST
2. **Security Non-Negotiable** - Security Auditor must approve deployment
3. **Pricing is Sacred** - 13% discount cap is absolute
4. **Update This File** - Every agent updates after completing work
5. **Surface Blockers Early** - Don't wait, report issues immediately

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Start new feature workflow
"Start [feature name] following the workflow from MRC-MULTI-AGENT-MCP-WORKFLOW-PLAN.md"

# Fix a bug
"Debug [issue] using Error Detective and appropriate agents"

# Pre-deployment check
"Execute pre-deployment workflow with all 5 mandatory agent checks"
```
