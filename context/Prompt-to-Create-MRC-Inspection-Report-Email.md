# Prompt to Create MRC Inspection Report Email

```
I have an MRC inspection report PDF. Please read it and create an email following the MRC email system guidelines.

**Context:**
- This is an INSPECTION REPORT (not completed work)
- The work has NOT been done yet - this is just findings and quote
- Use the INSPECTION REPORT EMAIL template
- DO NOT include Google review requests (only for completed work)
- DO NOT include email signatures or contact details
- Focus on findings, causes, solutions, and booking request

**Email Structure Required:**

Subject: MRC Mould Inspection Report – [Full Property Address]

Opening:
- Address client by name
- State attached document is "Mould Inspection Report"
- Brief summary of what was found and primary cause

Section 1: 🔍 Key Findings
- List affected areas
- Explain primary causes with technical detail
- Note any special circumstances (cross-contamination, water damage, etc.)

Section 2: 💡 Recommended Solutions
- Immediate Actions: What needs to happen first
- Ongoing Prevention: Long-term measures to prevent recurrence

Section 3: 💰 Treatment Options
- Describe the treatment approach in detail

Closing:

- Professional but warm tone
- NO signature block or contact details

**Key Rules:**
1. Extract ALL relevant details from the PDF (customer name, address, findings, causes, pricing)
2. Use Australian spelling and terminology
3. Use exact pricing from the report with "+ GST" format
4. Be comprehensive but clear - every line must add value
5. Use proper formatting: ## for headers, ** for bold, bullet points sparingly
6. Use --- for section separators
7. Professional but approachable tone
8. NO email signature at the end

**Special Situations to Watch For:**
- Cross-contamination of items (like this case with tenant belongings)
- Prerequisites for warranty (like waterproofing repairs needed first)
- VCAT or legal documentation requirements
- Multiple treatment options with different pricing
- Equipment hire or specialist coordination needed
- Insurance claim support requirements

Please read the attached PDF and create the email following this structure.
